I'll create a comprehensive solution architecture diagram for the autonomous inventory optimization system. This will show the complete system structure, agent interactions, and data flows.I've created a comprehensive solution architecture diagram for your autonomous inventory optimization system. Let me also create a detailed data flow diagram to show how information moves through the system:## **🏗️ Complete Solution Architecture Documentation**

I've created two comprehensive diagrams that illustrate your autonomous inventory optimization system:

### **📊 Diagram 1: Solution Architecture**
Shows the **complete system structure** with:

**🔧 System Layers:**
1. **External Systems Layer** - Data sources (ERP, IoT, APIs)
2. **System Manager Layer** - Orchestration and coordination  
3. **Communication Layer** - Inter-agent messaging
4. **Multi-Agent System Layer** - 7 specialized agents
5. **Data & Knowledge Layer** - Storage and models

**🤖 Agent Details:**
- **Demand Forecasting Agent**: Time series ML, seasonal analysis
- **Stock Monitoring Agent**: Real-time tracking, anomaly detection
- **Reorder Point Agent**: Dynamic ROP calculation using `ROP = (ADU × LT) + SS`
- **Inventory Allocation Agent**: Multi-objective optimization, supplier selection
- **Seasonal Adjustment Agent**: Pattern recognition, holiday impact
- **ABC Classification Agent**: Revenue-based grouping, XYZ analysis
- **Safety Stock Agent**: Service level optimization, statistical analysis

### **📈 Diagram 2: Data Flow & Process Architecture**
Shows the **operational workflow** with:

**🔄 Process Flow:**
1. **Data Ingestion** → Feature engineering from multiple sources
2. **ML Model Training** → Random Forest with feature selection
3. **Real-time Processing** → Demand forecasting, stock monitoring
4. **Decision Points** → Diamond shapes for critical decisions
5. **Actions** → Red boxes for system responses
6. **Feedback Loops** → Continuous learning integration

**💬 Message Types:**
- `DEMAND_UPDATE` - Forecast data sharing
- `INVENTORY_STATUS` - Stock level updates  
- `REORDER_ALERT` - Low stock notifications
- `ALLOCATION_REQUEST` - Purchase order requests
- `SEASONAL_ADJUSTMENT` - Pattern corrections
- `ABC_UPDATE` - Classification changes
- `SAFETY_STOCK_UPDATE` - Buffer adjustments

## **🎯 Key Architecture Benefits**
